# Analyzing-International-Debt-Statistic

In this project, I used SQL to analyze a large dataset of international debt statistics. The dataset contained information about the external debt of countries around the world, including their debt levels, creditors, and terms of borrowing. The goal of the project was to gain insights into the global debt landscape, identify trends and patterns in borrowing, and explore the relationships between debt and other economic indicators.
